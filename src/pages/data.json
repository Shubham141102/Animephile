    "synopsis": "Thanks to the sacrifices of war heroes like Amuro Ray, the Universal Century's 105th year sees an era of hard-won but short-lived peace. The Earth Federation keeps a militaristic hold on the planet and its surrounding space colonies. Although Char Aznable's rebellion against the neglectful Federation met its ultimate failure, his revolutionary philosophy of true freedom for all human beings lives on.\n\nDespite being the son of a famous Federation commander, Hathaway Noa embodies both the undying loyalty of soldier Amuro Ray and the militant passion of rebel leader Char Aznable. Haunted by memories of Char's Rebellion, Hathaway leads a dissident faction of his own known as Mafty. He adopts the alias \"Mafty Navue Erin\" and commits acts of violence in revolt against the growing tyranny of the Federation.\n\nAfter thwarting the hostile takeover of a plane by a terrorist group fraudulently claiming to be Mafty, Hathaway's secret identity is discovered by a young woman named Gigi Andalucia. Hathaway befriends both Gigi and Federation colonel Kenneth Sleg, but his double life endangers them as the armed conflict between Mafty and the Federation comes to a head.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although they have never encountered aliens before, Yuuhi is desperate to meet one as he believes that an alien has stolen his important item called the \"Earthdamar.\"\n\nOne day, while searching for extraterrestrial creatures, Yuuhi and Yuamu find a strange spot in the forest where many trees have fallen, forming a scenery similar to a crop circle. As they venture further, they discover a mysterious spaceship and enter it out of curiosity. To their surprise, they come across Yudias Velgear, an alien from the Velgear Star Cluster. As it turns out, Yudias is seeking to learn about Rush Duel—a card game popular among elementary school students—as he believes that it will save his home from a long war.\n\nWith the siblings agreeing to teach Yudias about Rush Duel, they eventually realize that their first contact with an alien may not be a random coincidence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The show is the ultimate family program and tends to follow traditional themes. Think of this show as the Japanese equivalent to \"The Partridge Family\" and you'll get a good feel for this show's atmosphere. Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

    "synopsis": "Hajime Aono used to live for the sound of his violin playing. Ever since he was young, he had admired his world-renowned violinist father, who inspired him to pick up the instrument himself. But following his parents' bitter divorce, Aono swears to never play again and heads for high school without a direction or a prospect.\n\nDuring a physical education class, the unathletic Aono gets struck in the face with a ball and ends up in the infirmary. There, he meets the brash Ritsuko Akine who begins to play the violin in the room, believing she is alone. However, following a past incident, there have been rumors claiming that Akine is a bully, which has isolated her from her peers—a fact Aono was unaware of.\n\nAkine dreams of enrolling in a school with an orchestra, but her amateurish playing and lack of musical knowledge grates on Aono immensely. Seeing this as a perfect opportunity for the two to become friends, their teacher suggests that Aono teaches Akine how to play the violin, something Aono is vehemently against. However, as the pair spends more time together, they soon learn to understand and help each other—and Aono may finally discover the lost passion and melody in his life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Akane Nishimura's quiet nature makes her classmates perceive her as a gloomy and unlikeable person. Combined with her intimidating gaze, it earns Akane the ominous nickname \"Grim Reaper,\" condemning her to endless bullying for her supposed cursed powers that bring misfortune to everyone around her.\n\nHowever, none of these rumors deter transfer student Taiyou Takada from trying to befriend Akane. As someone who finds the supernatural fascinating, Taiyou approaches the Grim Reaper without hesitation, blissfully unaware of the complicated situation within the class. His bright personality and optimistic worldview may just bring about the change that Akane desperately needs.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With the help of his new friends, Shiki will be able to breach Dragonfall—the border of the Sakura Cosmos swarming with mechanical dragons. Once that is achieved, he can continue his quest to find the goddess Mother.\n\nBefore the Edens Zero crew can advance their journey, they notice a mysterious warship following them. Upon learning that the ship—the Belial Gore—belongs to Drakken Joe, Shiki and his crew attempt to infiltrate it, intent on figuring out why the Dark Alchemist is after them. In the process, the Edens Zero is taken hostage by Drakken's subordinates.\n\nThough they are in a tight situation, Shiki refuses to back down. Working together with his friends, Shiki will have to take down the Dark Alchemist if he hopes to make it out of the Belial Gore alive.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To make ends meet, Ichirou rents out rooms in the apartment complex he inherited and works full-time as a shoujo manga artist. However, his manga sales are low, his assistants have recently left, and deadlines are fast approaching.\n\nAs stress threatens to overtake Ichirou, salvation comes in the form of an extremely competent novice artist, Shiori Goshiki, who becomes his new assistant. With her skills, they are able to tide over the difficult situation, and things begin looking up. But in a bizarre accident, a supernatural experience unfolds between Ichirou and Shirou, which leads her to declare them engaged.\n\nWith this seemingly innocuous action upending his life, Ichirou now has to manage his new and peculiar relationship with the mysterious girl, all the while following his own passion and fulfilling the duties that rest on his shoulders.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Kyoutarou Ichikawa may look like a shy and reserved middle school student, but deep within his heart is a bloodthirsty killer. His ultimate desire is to see his classmate Anna Yamada's beautiful face writhing in pain before he ends her life. But this fantasy may never come to fruition, as Ichikawa starts to see an entirely different side to Yamada.\n\nOften seeking refuge in the library, Ichikawa frequently runs into Yamada. It is during these encounters that Ichikawa realizes his model classmate is actually an airhead who can never read the room. As they spend more time together, the boy cannot help but feel not only a sense of endearment toward the very girl he wishes to murder but also a desire to protect her at all costs. Is it possible that this sudden change in Ichikawa's perspective could lead to something more?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Loading up Forest of Savior, the MMO they used to play together, she forms a plan to get back at her ex-boyfriend through an in-person event for the game. In the process, she runs into someone unexpected: Akito Yamada, a gaming legend who just happens to be her guildmate.\n\nDesperate for support, Akane ropes the asocial Yamada into helping with her scheme and lending her a shoulder to cry on. The differences between Akane and Yamada soon become apparent as they spend time together, yet they cannot help but notice each other's inner qualities. As the two gain more experience with one another in and out of the game, their tentative acquaintance may level up in a way neither expects.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, any tranquility is fleeting: sinister demons, kings, and deities plot Anos's demise from the shadows.\n\nRumors spread about the \"Child of God,\" a being whose power may rival that of Anos. To uncover the truth and eliminate the potential threat, Anos must journey deep into the land of spirits. However, the spirit world is shrouded in mystery, and it may only be entered after undergoing a series of difficult trials.\n\nWith unrivaled power and confidence, Anos braces himself to defeat various formidable enemies with grandiose titles. But he—with the assistance of his trusted allies—will barely have to break a sweat as the true Demon King of Tyranny.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Kenzou Tenma, a renowned Japanese neurosurgeon working in post-war Germany, faces a difficult choice: to operate on Johan Liebert, an orphan boy on the verge of death, or on the mayor of Düsseldorf. In the end, Tenma decides to gamble his reputation by saving Johan, effectively leaving the mayor for dead. As a consequence of his actions, hospital director Heinemann strips Tenma of his position, and Heinemann's daughter Eva breaks off their engagement. Disgraced and shunned by his colleagues, Tenma loses all hope of a successful career—that is, until the mysterious killing of Heinemann gives him another chance. Nine years later, Tenma is the head of the surgical department and close to becoming the director himself. Although all seems well for him at first, he soon becomes entangled in a chain of gruesome murders that have taken place throughout Germany. The culprit is a monster—the same one that Tenma saved on that fateful day nine years ago. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Guts, a former mercenary now known as the \"Black Swordsman,\" is out for revenge. After a tumultuous childhood, he finally finds someone he respects and believes he can trust, only to have everything fall apart when this person takes away everything important to Guts for the purpose of fulfilling his own desires. Now marked for death, Guts becomes condemned to a fate in which he is relentlessly pursued by demonic beings. Setting out on a dreadful quest riddled with misfortune, Guts, armed with a massive sword and monstrous strength, will let nothing stop him, not even death itself, until he is finally able to take the head of the one who stripped him—and his loved one—of their humanity.

    "synopsis": "As the 20th century approaches its end, people all over the world are anxious that the world is changing. And probably not for the better. Kenji Endo is a normal convenience store manager who's just trying to get by. But when he learns that one of his old friends going by the name \"Donkey\" has suddenly committed suicide, and that a new cult led by a figure known as \"Friend\" is becoming more notorious, Kenji starts to feel that something isn't right. With a few key clues left behind by his deceased friend, Kenji realizes that this cult is much more than he ever thought it would be—not only is this mysterious organization directly targeting him and his childhood friends, but the whole world also faces a grave danger that only the friends have the key to stop. Kenji's simple life of barely making ends meet is flipped upside down when he reunites with his childhood friends, and together they must figure out the truth of how their past is connected to the cult, as the turn of the century could mean the possible end of the world.

His hefty workload impedes on his social life, making him an easy target for bullies. One day, while being beaten up by a group of high school students, Ippo is saved by a boxer named Mamoru Takamura, and is brought to the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. This afterschool bullying session turns his life around for the better as Ippo discovers his latent talent for boxing and decides to practice the sport professionally. However, Mamoru doubts Ippo's determination and assigns him a task deemed impossible to complete, but the resolute Ippo trains tirelessly to fulfill his mission. Along the way, he finds out what it means to attain true strength while making new friends and fighting formidable foes. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "At the tender age of twelve, Mitsuki Kouyama has a sarcoma in her throat. Though this rare cancer can be cured by removing her vocal cords, Mitsuki refuses because of her desire to become a pop singer and keep her childhood promise to Eichi Sakurai, her first love who left for America. Unable to both heal and keep her voice, she allows her health to deteriorate as she accepts her tragic fate. One day, while escaping the home of her music-hating grandmother to attend an audition, Mitsuki meets two shinigami Takuto Kira and Meroko Yui. Realizing that Mitsuki can see them, Takuto and Meroko reveal to her that she will die in a year. Moved by her plight, Takuto allows Mitsuki the chance to pursue her dream by giving her the ability to transform into a healthy sixteen-year-old girl. After being chosen for a contract with Seed Records, Mitsuki makes her debut under the stage name Full Moon and chooses to pursue her dream music career before her life's end.

When a mysterious man attempts to monopolize Sakura's ability, her memories scatter throughout different worlds in the form of feathers. To save Sakura, Syaoran seeks help from the Dimensional Witch and meets two other travelers—Kurogane and Fai D. Flourite. Kurogane, a capable fighter and ninja, has been banished from his homeworld and wishes to return. In contrast, Fai, a magician from Celes, wants to traverse different worlds to avoid his home and past. As the price to cross dimensions, each of the three must sacrifice their most valued possession. For Sakura's sake, Syaoran agrees to give away their relationship as payment to the Dimensional Witch. And with firm determination, Syaoran, Kurogane, and Fai begin journeying through numerous worlds to fight against their ill-fated destinies. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Whenever Naruto Uzumaki proclaims that he will someday become the Hokage—a title bestowed upon the best ninja in the Village Hidden in the Leaves—no one takes him seriously. Since birth, Naruto has been shunned and ridiculed by his fellow villagers. But their contempt isn't because Naruto is loud-mouthed, mischievous, or because of his ineptitude in the ninja arts, but because there is a demon inside him. Prior to Naruto's birth, the powerful and deadly Nine-Tailed Fox attacked the village. In order to stop the rampage, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his life to seal the demon inside the body of the newborn Naruto. And so when he is assigned to Team 7—along with his new teammates Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, under the mentorship of veteran ninja Kakashi Hatake—Naruto is forced to work together with other people for the first time in his life. Through undergoing vigorous training and taking on challenging missions, Naruto must learn what it means to work in a team and carve his own route toward becoming a full-fledged ninja recognized by his village.

    "synopsis": "For as long as he can remember, high school student Ichigo Kurosaki has been able to see the spirits of the dead, but that has not stopped him from leading an ordinary life. One day, Ichigo returns home to find an intruder in his room who introduces herself as Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper tasked with helping souls pass over. Suddenly, the two are jolted from their conversation when a Hollow—an evil spirit known for consuming souls—attacks. As Ichigo makes a brash attempt to stop the Hollow, Rukia steps in and shields him from a counterattack. Injured and unable to keep fighting, Rukia suggests a risky plan—transfer half of her Soul Reaper powers to Ichigo. He accepts and, to Rukia's surprise, ends up absorbing her powers entirely, allowing him to easily dispatch the Hollow. Now a Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo must take up Rukia's duties of exterminating Hollows and protecting spirits, both living and dead. Along with his friends Orihime Inoue and Yasutora Sado—who later discover spiritual abilities of their own—Ichigo soon learns that the consequences of becoming a Soul Reaper and dealing with the world of spirits are far greater than he ever imagined.

    "synopsis": "Fifty years ago, the wielders of the sacred Rave stones fought against an onslaught caused by demon stones called Dark Bring. This war resulted in an explosion known as \"Overdrive\"—a blast so powerful that it sent the Dark Bring into a deep slumber and scattered the pieces of Rave across the world. In the present, Haru Glory lives a peaceful life on Garage Island until one day, he catches the creature Plue while fishing. Plue is later recognized by Shiba Roses, an old man who happens to be the original Rave Master. Shiba explains that the Dark Bring has resurfaced, and that to stop it, assembling the scattered parts of Rave is of utmost urgency. However, before Shiba can leave on this mission, he is attacked by a soldier from the evil organization Demon Card, forcing him to transfer the power of Rave to Haru. With the fate of humankind resting on his shoulders, the new Rave Master begins his quest to find the scattered Rave fragments. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Negi Springfield, a 10-year-old wizard who recently graduated from Merdiana Magic Academy in Wales, hopes to achieve two things—to find his missing father, who was once known as the Thousand Master, and to become a Magister Magi, someone who helps the everyday world through magic. To reach his latter goal, he is assigned one last task: to teach English at a middle school in Japan. Much to his surprise and dismay, he not only discovers that his homeroom class consists of 31 girls, but also ends up revealing his true identity as a magician to Asuna Kagurazaka, one of his new students. Negi must now negotiate with the girl and face his most difficult challenge yet—to keep his identity a secret as he tackles magical threats both from within and outside of Mahora Academy, all the while keeping a watchful eye out for his lost father.

    "synopsis": "It is said that if a couple gets into the University of Tokyo together, they will live happily ever after. However, for Keitarou Urashima, UTokyo is a distant dream. After failing the entrance exams twice already, he decides to stay at his grandmother's inn in Tokyo in order to prepare for his third attempt. He is, therefore, surprised when he finds out that not only has his grandmother gone on a long vacation, but the inn has also become the Hinata House, an all-girls dormitory! Unfortunately for Keitarou, a series of misunderstandings during his first visit leave him with five untrusting tenants. But when Haruka Urashima, his aunt who works at the dorm, brings up that he is supposedly a UTokyo student, the girls' impressions of him quickly change, and they reluctantly allow him to stay. Feeling guilty about the lie, he slowly gets to know his new neighbors: the cute yet violent Naru Narusegawa, the cheeky and opportunistic Mitsune Konno, the soft-spoken Shinobu Maehara, the straight-laced Motoko Aoyama, and the mischievous Kaolla Su. Thus continues the unpopular Keitarou's difficult journey to get into UTokyo, all for the chance to fulfill his childhood promise to the only girl who has ever shown any interest in him and maybe, just maybe, meet her again...

    "synopsis": "Yukino Miyazawa is the perfect model student. Pretty, kind, good at sports, always at the top of her class. But she's not all that she seems. It's all an act of deception; she is really the self-confessed 'queen of vanity,' and her only goal in life is winning the praise and admiration of everyone around her. When she enters high school, she finally meets her match: Souichirou Arima, a handsome, athletic, popular, and very intelligent young boy. Ever since he stole the top seat in the class from her, Yukino has hated him, and has been plotting on how to take back her former place as the object of all other students' admiration. What she wasn't expecting, however, was that Souichirou, the very boy she hated, would confess his love for her. Or that he would find out about her deception—and use it to blackmail her! Together, they discover that they have more in common than they knew, and they slowly begin to bring out each other's inner selves.

    "synopsis": "When Hikaru Shindou discovers an old go board in his grandfather's attic, he is greeted by the spirit of an ancient go master, Fujiwara no Sai. Sai spent his life teaching the techniques of the board game to an emperor during the Heian era, and now in his ghostly state, he is eager to share his passion with the unsuspecting Hikaru. The only problem is that Hikaru is not all that interested in board games. But Sai is not easily dissuaded. Pressured by Sai's unrelenting desire to pursue something he refers to as the \"Divine Move,\" Hikaru begrudgingly consents to playing the game, executing moves as dictated by Sai. But slowly, intrigued by the dedication of his peers, he begins to learn the basics of the game. As Hikaru enters into the world of go, guided by his intangible tutor and inspired by his rival, Akira Touya, he cannot help but be drawn into the complex game as he grows determined to prove his own abilities. In a coming-of-age story centering around an ancient board game, Hikaru no Go tells the story of a boy maturing through the pursuit of his newfound passion. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Ryuk, a god of death, drops his Death Note into the human world for personal pleasure. In Japan, prodigious high school student Light Yagami stumbles upon it. Inside the notebook, he finds a chilling message: those whose names are written in it shall die. Its nonsensical nature amuses Light; but when he tests its power by writing the name of a criminal in it, they suddenly meet their demise. Realizing the Death Note's vast potential, Light commences a series of nefarious murders under the pseudonym \"Kira,\" vowing to cleanse the world of corrupt individuals and create a perfect society where crime ceases to exist. However, the police quickly catch on, and they enlist the help of L—a mastermind detective—to uncover the culprit. Death Note tells the thrilling tale of Light and L as they clash in a great battle-of-minds, one that will determine the future of the world. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Ten years have passed since the end of Bakumatsu, an era of war that saw the uprising of citizens against the Tokugawa shogunate. The revolutionaries wanted to create a time of peace, and a thriving country free from oppression. The new age of Meiji has come, but peace has not yet been achieved. Swords are banned but people are still murdered in the streets. Orphans of war veterans are left with nowhere to go, while the government seems content to just line their pockets with money. One wandering samurai, Kenshin Himura, still works to make sure the values he fought for are worth the lives spent to bring about the new era. Once known as Hitokiri Battousai, he was feared as the most ruthless killer of all the revolutionaries. Now haunted by guilt, Kenshin has sworn never to kill again in atonement for the lives he took, and he may never know peace until killing is a thing of the past. Now in the 11th year of Meiji, Kenshin stumbles upon Kaoru Kamiya, owner and head instructor of a small dojo being threatened to close its doors. The police force is powerless to stop the string of murders done in the name of her dojo by a man claiming to be the famous Battousai. Kenshin's wanderings pause for now as he joins Kaoru to clear both their names. But how long can he stay before his past catches up to him?

One day, the sisters' lives are turned upside down when their father announces that he has promised one of them to be married to a fellow martial artist's son in hopes of carrying on the family legacy. In addition to their mixed reactions, when the fiancé arrives, the last thing the Tendou family expects is Ranma Saotome and his father, Genma. Ranma has been training in China with his father until an unfortunate accident changed them both. Now, when water touches them, Ranma turns into a girl and Genma into a giant panda. Ranma ½ follows Ranma as he attempts to get along with his newly betrothed, the youngest of the Tendou sisters, Akane. As the two begin to attend the same school, they deal with fellow friends and rivals, all of whom have something to say about their engagement. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Thousands of years ago, there existed those gifted with the power of God. Their mission: to destroy the ominous evils that lurk in the darkness known as \"Akuma.\" Led by the Milenium Earl, Akuma seek to destroy fragments of \"Innocence,\" the only weapons capable of harming the Earl and his army and bring about the Great Flood from a hundred years ago. To prevent this tragedy from happening, the Black Order was formed as an organization dedicated to fighting the Earl. They recruit Exorcists, those with the inherent ability to accomodate Innocence, to fight against the Akuma. In the late 19th century, Allen Walker—a white-haired boy armed with Innocence that takes the form of his entire left arm and a cursed eye that can see Akuma—is sent to the Black Order. There, Allen meets various comrades from the Order—the mercurial Yuu Kanda, the kindhearted Lenalee Lee, and the cheerful yet mysterious Lavi. Despite their different personalities, they have one goal in mind: to bring salvation to the souls of Akuma and prevent the Earl from destroying the world. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Alchemists are knowledgeable and naturally talented individuals who can manipulate and modify matter due to their art. Yet despite the wide range of possibilities, alchemy is not as all-powerful as most would believe. Human transmutation is strictly forbidden, and whoever attempts it risks severe consequences. Even so, siblings Edward and Alphonse Elric decide to ignore this great taboo and bring their mother back to life. Unfortunately, not only do they fail in resurrecting her, they also pay an extremely high price for their arrogance: Edward loses his left leg and Alphonse his entire body. Furthermore, Edward also gives up his right arm in order to seal his brother's soul into a suit of armor. Years later, the young alchemists travel across the country looking for the Philosopher's Stone, in the hopes of recovering their old bodies with its power. However, their quest for the fated stone also leads them to unravel far darker secrets than they could ever imagine. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Six years ago, Kamui Shirou and siblings Fuuma and Kotori Monou were inseparable childhood friends. After the sudden, gruesome death of the Monou siblings' mother, Kamui was taken away from Tokyo by his own mother. In the years that passed, the two lived peacefully while Kamui strengthened his innate telekinetic abilities. When his mother passes away in 1999, her dying wish prompts him to return to Tokyo to face his \"destiny.\" When Kamui reappears in the city, his attitude has taken a drastic turn, and he displays the growth of his powers through violent confrontations in the streets. Various opponents come after him asking if he is \"Kamui,\" but they seem to be demanding something far more significant than his name. These fighters represent two opposite factions—the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth—who each wish to recruit him to their cause. Piecing together clues about the apocalyptic \"promised day,\" Kamui realizes that he holds the fate of the world in his hands. Depending on which group of Dragons he allies himself with, he can either choose to save the world—or end it. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "X is written and illustrated by the four-person team of CLAMP. It is currently incomplete, but CLAMP has stated their intention to one day conclude the series if they can. It started serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Asuka shoujo manga magazine in May 1992 and stopped serialization in March 2003. Events depicted in the manga were too similar for comfort to real-life disasters that occurred in Japan, which contributed to the series' halt. Chapters of X have been collected in eighteen and a \"half\" volumes, out of a total twenty-one volumes expected. X has been adapted into various anime that speculate about events that occurred before the manga started or after the point where the manga left off. The series was published in English by VIZ Media as 3-in-1 omnibus volume from November 8, 2011 to August 13, 2013.",
